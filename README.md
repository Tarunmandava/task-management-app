The Task Management Application is a web-based platform designed to facilitate collaborative task organization among multiple users, built as part of Assignment 02 for the MSCC/MSCBD Cloud Platforms & Applications module. Developed using Python with FastAPI and integrated with Google Firestore for data storage, the application allows users to create task boards, add tasks with titles, due dates, and completion statuses, and assign tasks to board members. Users can log in via Firebase authentication (using firebase-login.js), create boards, invite others to collaborate, and manage tasks through an intuitive interface powered by Bootstrap for responsive design. The system enforces strict access controls, ensuring only board creators can rename boards, add/remove members, or delete boards, while all members can edit or delete tasks. Key features include task completion tracking with timestamps, unassigned task highlighting, and board statistics for active, completed, and total tasks. The project adheres to the assignmentâ€™s requirements by implementing a robust parent-child data structure in Firestore, avoiding major bugs like duplicate task names or unauthorized actions, and maintaining a clean Git repository with a comprehensive .gitignore to exclude sensitive files like Firebase credentials. Deployable on Google App Engine, the application provides a seamless, user-friendly experience for task management, with all functionality accessible through dedicated pages for dashboards, boards, and individual tasks.
